Repository for the Big Ideas Lab 6: Version Control

The file Custom.ipynb contains a short Python program which takes two user inputs and prints out a message string using those inputs. The program first asks the user for their name, and after the user provides this the program asks the user for their favorite animal. Both of these inputs are stored in strings that are then concatenated into a message that welcomes the user to the class by name, and informs them that there are none of their favorite animal allowed in the classroom.
